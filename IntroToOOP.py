# Programming paradigm - an approach to organize and structure your code
# 2 common programming paradigms: Procedural programming and object oriented programming (OOP)
# Procedural programming - a step by step procedure is followed sequentially to solve a problem
# ex. C, 
# OOP - Real world entities or concepts are modeled using objects
# ex. Java, C#
# Python is flexible and able to support both paradigms
# Classes are blueprints for creating objects, specifys what data the object will have and what behaviors will be exhibited
# When we define a class, we create a new type, the values are instances and objects
# Instantation - creating a instance of a class
# Encapsulation- classes encapsulate state and behavior together
# State is maintained through variables
# Behaviors are implemented through methods
# A benefit of OOP is code reuseability
# You can inherit from existing classes to make new classes
# Data encapsulation gives extra data security
# Abstraction- Hide inner workings of system from user
# Polymorphism - one thing in many forms- can be implemented
